# Shopify Function App â€“ Product Discount Extension

This repository contains a Shopify app that implements a **Product Discount Function** using an [extension-only app architecture](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/app-extensions/build-extension-only-app). It uses Shopify Functions to apply dynamic, customer-specific discounts based on product and customer metafields.

> ðŸ’¡ This project is already configured and includes all necessary files for the discount function. Follow the instructions below to clone and deploy it to a new Shopify development store.

---

## Overview

This extension applies a discount to cart items based on structured JSON data stored in product metafields. Discounts can be:

- A **single discount** (applied regardless of quantity)
- A **bundle discount** (applied only when a quantity threshold is met)

The discount also requires a logged-in customer with a specific customer metafield (`custom.number`) to be present.

## Metafield Structure

### Product Metafield (`custom.discount_data`)

```json
[
  {
    "type": "single",
    "discount_message": "15% off for [collection 1] products",
    "discount_amount": 15
  },
  {
    "type": "bundle",
    "discount_message": "25% off for [collection 2] products",
    "discount_amount": 25,
    "qty": 4
  }
]
```

### Customer Metafield (`custom.number`)

```json
"card-12345"

Both metafields must be present and correctly formatted for the discount function to activate.
